# VR Spatial Training Game

This project was carried out over 2021-2022 for a Summer Research Project at the University of Auckland.

## Tools

The game has been created using the Unity game engine, making use of the SteamVR Plugin for VR extensions and functionality. The functionality of objects within the game have been coded in C# scripts.

## Research

Spatial skills have been shown to correlate with achievement in the STEM field. Studies indicate that spatial skills are malleable and could be trained. Although the link has not been proven strongly, the assumption that training spatial skills leads to an improved experience of STEM subjects has been made.

Virtual Reality is a rapidly evolving technology that has been chosen as the platform to train spatial skills in the form of a game. VR allows us to create immersive virtual environments which we have used to create the game.

Spatial Training tools are already abundant but they lack motivation and interest, especially in the age group being targetted. Studies have shown that spatial skills develop the most around the ages 10-12. Ideally, the game will be fun, immersive and capable of training multiple spatial tools simultaneously.

## Game Concept

The concept of the game is a Puzzle Shooter that requires the player to problem solve in First-Person and Third-Person views.
